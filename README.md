# Amazon Clone Web Page

This project is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript mockup of an Amazon-like e-commerce webpage, designed as a responsive and visually accurate clone. It is styled to simulate Amazon's navigation bar, hero section, product categories, and footer. The page utilizes the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) library for icons, and it is built with a mobile-first approach for better responsiveness on various devices.
